# bitKlavier: the prepared digital piano

Developed by Dan Trueman and Michael Mulshine.

bitKlavier takes inspiration from John Cage's <i>prepared piano</i>, but instead of screws and erasers we place a reconfigurable collection of digital machines between the virtual strings of the digital piano. Learn more at the <a href=http://bitklavier.com>bitKlavier website</a>.
